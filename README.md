# Random Quote

This project deployed [here](https://random-quote-web-app.vercel.app/) shows random quotes generated from the [quote API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable). With the [React Spinners Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spinners), we emulate a simple loading when the "Get quote" button is pressed.

Aside the random quote, the background of the page and the button color change. A function is called any time the button is clicked and this function aside getting a random quote also generates a random color.

With the interface, [bootsrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is used to facilitate the development.

## Future works

Add share buttons

Automatically change the text colors too
